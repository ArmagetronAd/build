The default autopackage build links statically with libxml2 and libftgl. For a fully
backwards compatible autopackages, both need to be compiled with apbuild. Here's how.

FTGL:
Fetch the sources, unpack them. Enter the "unix" subdirectory. Do

CC=apgcc CXX=apg++ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/autopackage
make
make install

This really only works from within the source directory.

libxml2:
Fetch the sources, unpack them. Do

CC=apgcc ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/autopackage
make
make install

Here, building into an external directory works.

----------------------------------------------------

To build the autopackage in a distribution build process, go to the parent directory of
this and do

make autopackage

This builds both the server and the client; append -server/-client to build only one.
With

make autopackage-legacyserver

a special version of the server is produced: it is dynamically linked against libxml2-2.6.0,
which doesn't support fetching DTDs. That shouldn't be required for the server anyway.

To build test packages, do

make test-server

or

make test-client

here. In this mode, which requires the main sources in ../../armagetronad,
the build will be incremental and save time testing. The resuling .package
can afterwards be found here.
