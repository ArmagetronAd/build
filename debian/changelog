armagetronad (0.2.8.0beta4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Fixed bugs:
    Windows version had a memory overwrite error causing crashes and weird behavior.
    The game quit when the chat key and a key bound to an instant chat were pressed to quickly.
    Votes expired too early on the client.
    Performance: a lot of unused temporary walls were hanging around each round.
    Cycles sometimes warped to odd locations.
  * Tweaked smart camera to not stay in front of the cycle so much.
    Tweaked smart camera custom glancing.
    Report back whether you like or hate it!
  * Made custom camera even more configurable, changed default settings.
    (old ones are still in settings.cfg)
  * Forced glancing end on cycle turn now looks better.
  * FOV settings now deal better with wide screens/splitscreen mode.
  * Increased ping measurements again by adding the fluctuations. The raw 
    average ping caused the game logic to be too picky.

armagetronad (0.2.8.0beta4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Famous fixed bugs: 
    Random huge felt lag or blank screen (it was actually a problem with the timer) is gone.
    Bogus "possible phase bug" message.
    Seemingly random walls popping out of nothing, only to disapear a second later.
    Random camera focus changes while you were still alive.
    Every 100th console line got deleted.
  * Reduced pings! Actually, just the measurement is improved, the actual latency
    stays the same. z-man: I read NEWS file ;)
  * New text editing convenience: Home and end keys work, and CTRL+left/right/del/backspace
    work on whole words. Thanks, Nemo!
  * New instant chat functions: There are now 25 instant chat strings. If an instant
    chat string ends in a \, it will not be sent immediately, it's opened to be edited by you.
    Pressing an instant chat key while already chatting will insert the string, provided the
    key does not produce a regular character.
  * If enabled by the server administrator: control your cycle while you chat.
  * Turning speed of custom and internal camera can be adjusted with CAMERA_CUSTOM_TURN_SPEED
    and CAMERA_IN_TURN_SPEED.
  * The custom camera zooms out from a closeup at round start. Useful to see your position
    in your team. Configurable with CAMERA_CUSTOM_ZOOM.
  * Master server redundancy enabled. Thanks to Lucifer for hosting the backup master!

armagetronad (0.2.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Server side cycle synchronization issues fixed:
    destination removal fixed
    lag sliding caused by different interpretion of grinding turn commands on client and server fixed
    niceness for older clients: sync interval decreased, no sync in front of wall to prevent local tunneling

    sync messages are no longer ignored,
    new extrapolating sync method implemented,
    ghosting fixed,
    wall ends sticking out fixed ( for enemy cycles ),
    the sophisitcated distance based sync code implemented years ago is now actualy used, oh dear.

    netobject synchroinzation does no longer traverse all netobjects
    disabled gameobject-gameobject interaction
  * added support for nonorthogonal driving directions
  * added support for debug recording and playback
