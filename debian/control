Description: Common files for the Armagetron Advanced packages
 Armagetron Advanced is a 3D game based on the light cycle racing in the movie
 "Tron". You have to control a light cycle that can only turn in steps of 90
 degrees, leaves a solid wall behind and can not be stopped.  The aim is to
 survive longest of all players by not crashing into any walls.
 .
 This package contains the common configuration files and documentation shared
 between the armagetronad and armagetronad-server packages.

Description: 3D Tron-like high speed game
 The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can only
 turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped) and have
 to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to get your
 opponent to run into them.
 .
 The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever
 wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this
 is your chance.  Of all the Tron clones out there, I think one is the one that
 comes closest to the feeling the movie tries to express.  This is in part
 thanks to the sophisticated camera motions, in part to the superb modelling
 work and in part to the fabulous sound effects.  To add some extra fascination
 into the game, unlike to other Tron clones, in armagetron you can accelerate.
 Alas, there's no accelerate button.  If you want to drive fast, you have to
 drive good -- and really really close to the walls.
 .
 Armagetron Advanced can be played against AI opponents, against other humans
 over the network, or a mixture of both.

Description: Dedicated server for Armagetron Advanced
 Armagetron Advanced is a 3D game based on the light cycle racing in the movie
 "Tron".  You have to control a light cycle that can only turn in steps of 90
 degrees, leaves a solid wall behind and can not be stopped.  The aim is to

 .
 This version of Armagetron Advanced can only be used as a network game server.
 It does  not have graphical output and can be controlled via the text console.
 .
 The normal Armagetron Advanced used for playing is also capable to serve games,
 but will  require X to display its graphics, will provide a player and is
 therefore  unsuited for permanent game servers.
