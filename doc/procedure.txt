How the releasse procedure works:
(This document is more of a "How z-man handles things when he
does a release", a documentation of how it's done rather than
how it should be done)

======= Case 1: The primary build. No tarball exists yet. =======

=== Step 1: Tag the Sources ===

Do a checkout of ALL modules (armagetronad, armagetronad_build,
armagetronad_build_visualc, armagetronad_build_codeblocks, 
armagetronad_winlibs currently) or update old checkouts to the
revisions that should go into the distribution. Use "cvs update -d"
so no directory is forgotten. Tag them with 
"cvs tag v<version with . replaced by _>".

=== Step 2: Get the Sources ===

Update a different copy of ALL modules to the tag that was just made.
All future work will be done here.

=== Step 3: Build ===

Enter the armagetronad_release module of the workspace. Run "make"
once to scan the sources and update all variables. Run "make full"
or another target of your choice to do the build. Z-Man does 
"make z-man-home", to just build a tarball, do "make tarsource".
See the makefiles and top level README.txt for details.

=== Step 4: Upload ===
Automatic uploading to the SourceForge ftp server is done with
"make upload". Semi-automatic upload to aabeta are done with
"make upload-aabeta". The aabeta user name needs to be set in
make.conf and will be used for the upload and build tag. 
If the www-aabeta module with releases.php is present
parallel to armagetronad_build, then appropriate entries will be
added to it, but AT THE END of the file. You need to manually
move them to the beginning and should check them.

========= Case 2: secondary builds. Tarball exists. =========

Check out the armagetronad_build module. Create a subdirectory
called "tarballs" in it and copy the tarball there. Proceed with
Step 4.

========= Case 3: Windows builds. =========
