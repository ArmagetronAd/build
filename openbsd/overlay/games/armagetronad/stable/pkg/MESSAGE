You will have to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
section similar to the following so that the server is started
automatically:

if [ -x /usr/local/share/armagetronad-dedicated/scripts/rcd_server ]; then
	echo -n ' armagetronad'
	/usr/local/share/armagetronad-dedicated/scripts/rcd_server start
fi
